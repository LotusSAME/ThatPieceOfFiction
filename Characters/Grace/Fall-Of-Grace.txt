Grace has fallen.
That's a common mantra among those who took the path of ideals and actions.
Grace was powerful, even more so than Beatrice, even more so than the most strategically significant übermensch foundation agents or the most directly and independently strong azure labs creations, but she knew that that was not sufficient to save her.
Grace gave up on working within her capabilities, and faced with futility, she could've remained alive, giving up on her steadfast determination to save the world to instead allow it to fester without revolution, but in the end, not even Chang'e, awake or not, could save her from her panicking, last gasp for a hope in fixing the world, and later her literal last gasps for air, in a river's bed, chained.
Only she could've saved herself then, but what use to her is her life if nothing she did led to any possibility of "better" consequences? 
Grace despised the übermensch and the chaos readers, but for no good reasons, only that they "collapsed possibility".
She could've survived if she had something beyond the river's bank, but she had no hope, even in chaos.
The vagabonds of western Europe, the eastern European and the Mediterranean "private detectives", the "anomaly researchers" of Australia, Aotearoa, and the Pacific, and even the übermensch and the more "devout" azure labs "staff", repeat similar such phrases sometimes, "Grace has fallen", tragic as her death is, it was turned to a concept, all separate from that woman who allowed herself to be killed, sometimes in insult, sometimes in reverance, oftentimes a cautionary tale, sometimes to not give up, sometimes to give up on even trying.
