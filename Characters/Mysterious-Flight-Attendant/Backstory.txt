She is an anomaly originating from the E.S. world's Point Nemo, but not in the E.S. world itself, rather, she's from the "bridge" world.
She originally had the original form of her E.S. world "parallel", but she quickly settled to a human form when she was first observed.
She goes by "Attendant Sally", and that's the only name she ever had.
She resembles her E.S. world parallel's "Tanuki" form, minus the "Tanuki" features.

Point Nemo of the "bridge" world has an massive island of extremely hard glass on it, she saved herself (and a stranded übermensch foundation agent) from getting "cooked" by the sun and glass by escaping to a boat that two extremely reckless teenagers tend to frequent Point Nemo of the E.S. world with.
That übermensch foundation agent quit her job on the spot and is enjoying her life in South Africa.

Attendant Sally is travelling the world, unable to get out of her "bottle airplane space" but always eager to do her "job" with due diligence.
She might falsely express regretting "a lack of professionalism", but she does not regret eavesdropping or chatting with "passengers", it is a significant part of the reason why she does her "job" to begin with.
Another significant reason is that she enjoys doing her "job", and she's good at her "job".
