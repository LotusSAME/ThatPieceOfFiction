"Didn't think much of it, got asked once before about my name and I felt more comfortable with this answer, so I went with it"
	-Attendant Sally

"Attendant" here is part of the name, actually.
I came up with that part of her name because I pictured her as a "flight attendant", from attire to attitude.
Her "job" is pretty much that of the entire flight crew, however, if I were to go with the analogy.
