Born in E.S. world Aotearoa, her parents died in a trainwreck.
She was raised in a commune as an orphan, all was alright until an accident caused all sorts of trouble.
Alice's anomaly is universal, and affects everyone, some to a greater extent than others.
The wild witch and the elusive witch volunteered to manipulate the anomaly to prevent the "disalignment" of the E.S. world.
The solution they chose was to make it collapse on a volunteer who roamed Spain, "the Andalusian"... 
They did a "little slip" and it instead collapsed on someone in Aotearoa who happens to be Alice.
The witches didn't change their plans as this didn't exceed acceptable parameters.
Alice's anomaly was later discovered by the übermensch foundation because someone was abusing her using her anomaly.
That abuser knew how that anomaly works perfectly, and was, at a time before, manipulated similarly.
He tried to kill her as to escape getting caught, he forgot to physically restrain himself before connecting that time, which helped her search for help with shaking the abuser out of "sleep", meanwhile an übermensch foundation agent discovered her body when her abuser tried to kill it and rescued her as she "woke up" to a horrible pain.
That attempt to kill her using her anomaly backfired horribly as it attracted the attention of people who are impossible to effectively hide from: the associates of the E.S. world witch and the übermensch foundation.
Alice survived this apparent "suicide attempt" with severe bruising and numerous lacerations.
It was discovered that her anomaly can connect to people in other worlds, including "mushrooms from beyond the threshold".
The person who rescued her by "waking" her abuser up is "the Andalusian", they are a strange person who used to be a mark at the time of rescuing her.
