5'00" tall, strong, cute, and very masculine looking, serious, historian and "calculus god", a great teacher and a kind and forgiving person, though commanding at times, he may be quick to apologize for that when informed of the tone and might then suggest alternative courses of action in a less commanding tone, he tries to be the best he could be at any time.
At least, he was that, even when he survived his first home city getting destroyed, but things changed when he met Beatrice that second time, now he is "yet another wandering nomad", living to live, irritated and irritating, no motivations, no connections or relations, just the passerbys and occasional "guild" work.
Beatrice was alive, and guardians lied, Edward Suit never managed to get past that.
WhiteRock was his second, and probably last, home.
