Alice's anomaly is an "extra mind" of sorts, connected to every "medium for consciousness" in the E.S. world.
Anyone in any world can connect to that "extra mind", and a "medium for consciousness" that starts its existence in the E.S. world has such an "extra mind".
Proximity to the antipode of that "medium for consciousness"'s location relative to any sufficiently large object can make the likelihood of a stronger connection greater.
Having such an "extra mind" can make a two-way connection possible and the likelihood of a stronger connection greater.
Being in the same world as the "extra mind" can make the likelihood of a stronger connection greater.
It was discovered that her anomaly can connect to people in other worlds, including "mushrooms from beyond the threshold".
Although not necessarily a "Mediterranean anomaly", it does have a "faint cyan and blue" "vibe".
