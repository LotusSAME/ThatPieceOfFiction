Born in E.S. world Aotearoa, her parents died in a trainwreck.
She was raised in a commune as an orphan, all was alright until an "accident" caused all sorts of trouble.
Alice's anomaly is universal, and affects everyone, some to a greater extent than others.
The wild witch and the elusive witch volunteered to manipulate the anomaly to prevent the "disalignment" of the E.S. world.
The solution they chose was to make it collapse on a volunteer in Spain... 
They did a "little slip" and it instead collapsed on someone in Aotearoa who happens to be Alice.
The witches didn't change their plans as this didn't exceed acceptable parameters.
Alice's anomaly was discovered by the übermensch foundation because someone was abusing her using her anomaly.
That abuser knew how that anomaly works perfectly, and was, at a time before, manipulated similarly.
He tried to kill her as to escape getting caught, he forgot to physically restrain himself before connecting, but he managed to keep her from causing a two-way connection, and she was restrained back then.
That attempt to kill her using her anomaly backfired horribly as it attracted the attention of people who are impossible to effectively hide from.
It was discovered that her anomaly can connect to people in other worlds, including "mushrooms from beyond the threshold".
