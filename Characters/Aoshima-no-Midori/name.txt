Jack Smith was not named after his father, nor after his mother.
Born during the second "collapse", both RED and Aoshima no Midori were orphans.
This is about Aoshima no Midori's name.
Midori was Jack Smith's father.
I named him Midori because I intended for him to have a traditionally feminine name, and I thought just calling him "Green from Blue-Island" was a good contrast to (ALL UPPERCASE) RED.
I don't remember if I named him before, but he's still a hard-working idealist who died in a car accident.
The car that turned out to become his deeply submerged coffin is specifically a red, boxy, safely modified old car that he takes to work when it is not all office work and he has to go around to deliver sensitive information or sensitive equipment.
No conspiracy behind his death, really.
It really was an accident, and RED knew it.
It still hurts her bitterly, and RED still moves on, nothing can be done.
Jack was still a toddler when Aoshima no Midori died.
Anyway, TMI, his name is Aoshima no Midori.
