MAX has two "moods";
"Art Deco" and "Art Nouveau".
Named as such for their influence on how his "library environment" looks like.
"MAX used to also have an Art Aero mood, but it died along with his hope."
Also, MAX is one of the few characters with names written in all caps, another three are SCARLET, RED, and ODONATA... if I recall correctly.
