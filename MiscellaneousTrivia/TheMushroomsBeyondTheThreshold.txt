The Mushrooms beyond the threshold could better be thought of as something like a sentient planet with a hivemind of thoroughly conntected, yet still individual, organ-brains with varying degrees of specialization and adaptability, with some of them occasionally being "insignificant" enough to be "nerves" in the grand scheme of things at a given moment, even though all of them can function on their own.

While they are not the root cause of anomalies or the only vector of their occurence, the significant presence of anomalies in the Bridge World, E.S. World,and the world they are tangible in, and the occurence of reset events, and the existence of guardians, magical people, and "mushroom molts", are all related to them.

Mushroom Molts prove that the mushrooms beyond the threshold work as some sort of a "perspective", though.
