Alice has met JUDAS before the "simulation" started.

They were really good, really quick, friends.

JUDAS knew that she cannot leave the "Kenoma" she will enter before Alex Drifter can, and that she might die if that "Kenoma" is not shut down safely, and had to lie to Alice about the risks in order to get an OK.

Alice knows she lied, but couldn't bring herself to confront that before it was too late.

Alice still feels guilty about it, but she is no longer incapable of coping with or evading the thought of it.

Besides, that's the only way JUDAS knows could save her old friend Alex from being trapped forever.

The "JUDAS" of the "Kenoma", however, is just a ruse, a distraction Alex set up in that "Kenoma" to avoid being "saved", but he knows it will not misdirect anyone who knows real JUDAS.

Real JUDAS is stuck where Alex would be stuck if JUDAS failed, and can only be rescued if Alex Drifter is saved or if JUDAS fails.

Real JUDAS is a person who was among those who were saved from Azure Labs when ODONATA "escaped", Alice met her when she was recovering from her stay at Azure Labs.

Michelle Grandeur has no idea who JUDAS was.

Alex Drifter never knew what happened to JUDAS before he committed to that "Kenoma" project, which is why he allowed "JUDAS" to be a character in the simulation.

(Author's note: yep; that's indeed meta, you may cringe at it later.)
