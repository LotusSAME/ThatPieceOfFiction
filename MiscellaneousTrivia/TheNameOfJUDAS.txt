IIRC, although JUDAS is written uppercase, her case, and that of all residents of that "simulation" other than Alex Drifter, isn't counted as one of the "UPPERCASE NAMES".
She is named after the biblical Judas, though I do welcome reading it as some variation of Judith, as that is the name her parents named her, 
her parents didn't name her after the biblical character Judas, the author(s) of this story did, just a pop culture reference.
Like her namesake, she wasn't the best ally.
Unlike her namesake, she did not betray Alex.
She's REALLY not a good ally, though.
She's what some people mean when they write out something like "Ally (derogatory)".
