Her name didn't start as JUDAS (ALL CAPS), but she permitted herself to name herself like that, and she does write her name like that.
In a sense, ALL CAPS names are names of characters that would choose to write their own names in ALL CAPS if they were given the choice to do so.
This is the significance of ALL CAPS names, really.
She would say "My name is JUDAS." the same way some other person who is named Judas would say "My name is Judas", as in that the CAPITALIZATION doesn't change how the name is spoken from the origin of it, only how it is written.
I, the author, named after the biblical Judas, though I do welcome reading it as some variation of Judith, as that is the name her parents named her; 
her parents didn't name her after the biblical character Judas, the author(s) of this story did, just a pop culture reference.
Like her namesake, she wasn't the best ally.
Unlike her namesake, she did not betray Alex.
She's REALLY not a good ally, though.
She's what some people mean when they write out something like "Ally (derogatory)".
She tries "her best" but her best would be better than that.
Perhaps one day, JUDAS will be saved, Alice will heal, and Alex will overcome nihilism and be saved too, but will those stories be told?
