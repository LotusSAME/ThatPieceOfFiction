Not even "god herself".

Nay, ESPECIALLY not "god herself".

Everyone values MAX's work, including some of the "enlightened"..., except MAX, who is terrified by it.

Unlike the "enlightened", he doesn't know what it will lead to, and even the most generous of the "enlightened" refuse to tell him, sometimes even breaking their own personal rules to deny him knowledge of that.

How cruel of the "enlightened"... worse is that they know that this is not the only way to ensure it happens, just one of the "easier" ones, not even the easiest.
