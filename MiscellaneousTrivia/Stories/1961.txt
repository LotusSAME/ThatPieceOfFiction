Yuri Gagarin returned from space.

The worlds will never be the same again.

In this story, before 1961, history did not differ much from the reality that inspired it.

The Jovian gods committed suicide but didn't die as easily as they expected, they die later in the 2020s, until then they are not tormented by their sensory deprivation.

Back to Yuri Gagarin, the Jovians' plunge into Jupiter began as he returned to Earth, the first anomalies began making the worlds distinct then.

Anomalies have no function, but approximate the appearance of purpose for an uninformed observer; for the mushrooms beyond the threshold, the anomalies are useful for experiments, while for the few non-hivemind people who can control them, anomalies are convenient tools, for those who could not control the type of anomalies they cause, anomalies feel like a plot device that keeps the story of the world interesting, those who could not create anomalies but could control them see those anomalies as tools or abilities, while those who cannot control the anomalies they are afflicted with tend to think of those anomalies as curses...

Ah, that was a bit of rambling, was it not?

This is some spoilers for you, Durra; your world is not real, you are not real, you cannot die, you cannot lie.

Now, what's the use of your dad's name anyway? and that of his last name?

Garbage.

Let's rid the world of those, huh.

Ah, the author sure is authoritarian, huh.

Notice what happened? not even the palimpsest survives.

And yet she binds herself to rules as to allow the communication...

Now, Durra, every you will survive.

Also, would you like the name Cassandra? me neither.
