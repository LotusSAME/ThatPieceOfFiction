He looks so... "sinister"? "sinister" may not be the nicest or most accurate word, but-

Dude's less sinister than a- UGH I am at a loss for words for a comparison.

I mean-

Dude's less sinister than a patch of grass, that's a comparison.

Point taken, but what's with the skulls?

You are inside one, well, most of you, nothing sinister about that.

Well-

I mean most of that makes you you, y'know?

I-

I mean the "you-ness" of you; I mean, the body is arguably also part of you in the same sense memory is, but that's beside the point.

Please don't interrupt too much.

Oh.

I understand, but it makes social communication difficult to both of us.

I... I have a problem.

No, you are just too excited by yourself. Remember what you said about your brain branching?

"Don't overwhelm yourself" and "think of the phrasing instead of repeatedly correcting".

That wasn't the lesson.

Yea, I forgot it.

I did too, but take a breath, and try to recall; why did you correct yourself this time?

Same as always; accuracy.

You excited yourself over trying to get a point across, you were being faster than your own ability to communicate, like hurriedly scribbling a note and taking longer to correct it than it would've took to calmly write it.

OK, that was surprisingly apt.

Thank you.

It was nothing; I was telling you how I saw it.

Nah, it was help.

I see, thank you.
