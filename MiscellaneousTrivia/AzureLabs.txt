They are a cult.

Simple as.

They pledge no true fealty, but often cooperate with the Inubashiri "empire".

They are not deliberatelly cruel, but they will break the Nuremberg code if they felt a "need" to without a hitch.

The Inubashiri "empire" requires their that weaponized "subjects" be regularly returned for "testing", and even otherwise, AzureLabs staff make sure their "test subjects" survive and remain conscious.

Those "test subjects" are "a valuable resource" to them, after all.

Once those "experiments" are completed, the victim is either sold to the Inubashiri "empire" in exchange for resources and security, or "evicted" to the nearest accommodation, to be discovered by an uninvolved civilian.
