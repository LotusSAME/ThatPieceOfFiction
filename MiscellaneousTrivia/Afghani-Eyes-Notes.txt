In Afghanistan of both the Ecilipse world and the E.S. world, doing someone a favor or giving them a gift they appreciate rewards you and them with a fixed "reward" of one "Afghani Eyes Note" to every involved person; those notes appear in a surprising, but not inconvenient, way and they have the portraits of all involved people depicted on one side, and the other has the silhouettes of that side with eyes visible, with the "closeness" of the depiction dependent on the "closeness" of the involvement, they currently don't have much of a value outside of their cultural significance as what qualifies as a favor or an appreciated gift seems to be very broad.
Those "Afghani Eyes Notes" can come in any regular hexagonally tiling shape, but they most commonly come in regular hexagons of a specific side length.
The material those "Afghani Eyes Notes" are made of is a tough, but ultimately biodegradable, polymer fabric, though there exist ways to preserve them.
They have no anomalous properties other than their occurence.
