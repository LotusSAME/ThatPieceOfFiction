and who is red and scarlet?
RED is Jack Smith's mother, a widow insisting it is her own story.
In a sense, Jack Smith is her son, Aojima no Midori is her very dead husband, and she is making sure her story is hers' not that of her relation to the men in her life.
A biologist and a cyberneticist.
She makes C.O.R.E. prosthetics and tools.
Has massive wings made from that stuff.
She is very mean and protective of her son, though.
And will stop at literally nothing to distance him from the nonsense she has been up to. (edited)
Especially with her friends and enemies.
SCARLET is an ex-nun ex-Catholic.
She was also a medic and a teacher.
She practically was RED's mother.
Practically, because RED's birth mother died.
She saved RED from AzureLabs and the  and escaped with her.
BTW ALL CAPS names are written ALL CAPS.
This includes MAX and ODONATA.
She is what made RED who she now is.
I had a really old drawing of her but I lost it, so I suppose she's due for a redesign.
She's one of the people frustrated with the subtext of their own writing.
