Portals how do they work, and why are they limited to the gods and foundation?
The foundation learned how to make them from observing the "goblins that steal anything" anomaly.
They don't understand how those portals function on a fundamental level, but they understand the world-state altering part.
Are the goblins aware of this, and do they retaliate or interfere with portal usage by the foundation?
They are an anomaly, and they steal anything.
Otherwise, they cease to exist.
I wrote about that.
Does this partial understanding affect the foundation’s ability to control the portals? Could a failed portal experiment create new anomalies or disruptions in the world-states?
This is a disorganized text I am trying to fix, unfortunately the answer is in it.

It doesn't affect the foundation’s ability to control the portals, but it prevents them from accidentally creating four completely empty worlds.
Because they might try to alter a third world-state.
Doubling the number of possible world-states.
Or even do it twice and quadruple it.
But practically, that'd result in them getting stranded in an otherwise completely empty void.
Plus that their portals check to prevent intersection with existing objects by momentarily swapping the world-state of photons at the destination.
Same method as in the lunar portals.
And they swap the world-state of things in the portal the same way too.
As in: if something is already in the destination, the portal won't start.
This prevents accidents and informs the user of the destination.
