RED picked up the habit of writing her own name in ALL CAPS from SCARLET.

A lot of RED's "odd" habits come from SCARLET like that.

SCARLET picked up this habit from the same person ODONATA picked up this habit from, but that someone dropped the habit when he lost everything including his name.

I don't know if I should feel sorry for this guy, I can't say anyone deserves what happened to him, there's only hope he becomes better and escapes as he is regaining his memory in "hell".

For someone so insistent on making her story her own, she is rather aware that being so stringent about it would destroy her.

RED will make her story her own in a meaningful way, and that will be good for her and for the world, this doesn't mean that habits she picked up from someone else are not hers'.
